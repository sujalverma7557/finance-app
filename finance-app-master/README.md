### **How to Use This README**
1. **Replace Placeholders**:
   - Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` and `your_jwt_secret_key` with your actual MongoDB connection string and JWT secret key when you set up the project.
2. **Update Later**:
   - Once youâ€™ve customized the project, you can add **screenshots**, **detailed setup instructions**, and **your contributions** to the README.

### **Key Tips**
1. **Keep It Simple**: Since youâ€™re just copying the project for now, this README is minimal and doesnâ€™t include unnecessary details.
2. **Update as You Go**: As you customize the project, update the README to reflect your changes and contributions.
3. **Be Honest**: If you followed a tutorial, mention it in the **Acknowledgments** section.
